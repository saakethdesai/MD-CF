#The distance cutoff is 0.4 nm and the angle is provided in the format {LowAngle} {HighAngle}
#such that a bond is created if both the improper angles associated with the possible bond
#are greater than {LowAngle} and lesser than {HighAngle}

#If the angle values are increased to {100} and {180}, a bond will be created between atoms
#2 and 4. To accept all angles, provide values such that {LowAngle} > {HighAngle}. An example is
#{LowAngle} = 90 and {HighAngle} = 89
