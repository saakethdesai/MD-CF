#The distance cutoff is 0.4 nm and the angle is provided in the format {LowAngle} {HighAngle}
#The system consists of 4 chains and bonds are created between different sets of chains
#depending on the angle cutoff used

#If the angle values are low, like {20} and {180}, bonds will be created between
#chains beside  each other and the final structure is lowangle.data
#If the angle values are increased to {100} and {180}, bonds will be created between
#chain facing each other and the final structure is highangle.data
