This document provides a guide to using the examples provided to verify the
successful installation of the distribution. For each example provided, copy
the directory to any location of your choice and run LAMMPS by replacing
"lmp < bondcreate.in" with "/path/to/exectuable/lmp_mpi < bondcreate.in" 
in your simulations. (quotes only for emphasis)

The directories "test1" and "test2" contain test cases that verify whether the
executable successfully implements the angle criterion check before performing
bond creation.

The directories "300K" and "2500K" are simulations for which results have been
reported in the paper. In both these cases, the initial structure is given by
initial.data and the final structure is given by final.data. 

To run any crosslinking simulations, please label your initial structure as
1.data. Intermediate structures will be generated as "x.data", where "x" is the
current cycle number of the algorithm. Please see the individual input files 
for further details.
