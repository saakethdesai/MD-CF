What is this?
---------------
This set of files and directories contains the code used to simulate the 
crosslinking algorithm presented in our paper. This code was
written by Saaketh Desai at Purdue University, under the guidance of 
Prof. Alejandro Strachan.

Installing this code
---------------------
To install this code, follow the steps below:

1. Download the source code for LAMMPS to your local machine.
   For details, please see the instructions provided in the following link:
   lammps.sandia.gov/download.html

2. Copy the files fix_bond_create.h and fix_bond_create.cpp, provided in the 
   "code" directory of our distribution, to the MC sub-directory within
   the src directory of the downloaded LAMMPS source code

3. Build LAMMPS using the following commands (for a linux machine)
   a. make yes-mc
   b. make yes-molecule
   c. make yes-user-diffraction
   d. make mpi
   For further information on building LAMMPS with additional packages for 
   other systems, please visit the "Building LAMMPS" section of the LAMMPS 
   documentation. The instructinons provided here only use the packages 
   required to reproduce results presented in our paper

4. If the build was successful, an executable "lmp_mpi" will be created in the
   current directory. This executable can then be used to run lammps by replacing
   "lmp < in.xx" with "/path/to/exectuable/lmp_mpi < in.xx" in your simulations
   (quotes only for emphasis)
